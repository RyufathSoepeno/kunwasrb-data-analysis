|[Principal Component Analysis on Bureaucracy Indicators](https://github.com/RyufathSoepeno/kunwasrb-data-analysis/blob/main/1.%20Principal%20Component%20Analysis%20on%20Bureaucracy%20Indicators.ipynb)|This project focuses on data analysis of component indicators using advanced statistical techniques. The analysis includes dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the most significant components, assessment of data suitability using the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) measure, detection of outliers to improve data quality, and evaluation of categorical consistency to ensure reliable classification and interpretation. These methods are applied to enhance the robustness, accuracy, and interpretability of the underlying data structure|December|<img width="1140" height="731" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7bb626d-4329-4a81-bfab-d249f4f982bd" /> <img width="1117" height="585" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/266709f1-dbdb-4ecd-9eac-c286d94d39d6" />|
